\f0\fs24 \cf0 Welcome to the installer for Delay Troll, a revolutionary multi-tap delay audio plugin developed by Temples of Silence Studios. Whether you're a professional audio engineer or a hobbyist musician, this plugin is perfect for you. With its easy-to-use "gravity" parameter that allows you to adjust the delay time of all taps at once, you'll be able to add depth and dimension to your tracks like never before. Delay Troll allows you to create complex echo patterns by applying multiple, separately-adjustable delay times to a signal each with their own pitch, EQ and level. This opens up a lot of creative possibilities for sound design, from simple delays to complex rhythms and patterns. It's often used in music production to enhance the depth and stereo image of a mix, to create rhythmical effects, or even to create a sense of space in a recording. You will be able to create complex echo patterns and syncopations that will take your music to the next level. We are confident that you will love using Delay Troll as much as we loved creating it.}
